Subject = ('I', 'You') # varibale named "subject" contain two string 
Verb = ('Play', 'Love') # varibale named "verb" contain two string 
Objectt = ('Hockey', 'Football') # varibale named "object" contain two string
with open ("Sentence_Genator.txt", 'w') as phrase: # to create new file 
	for sub in Subject: 
		for v in Verb:
			for o in Objectt: # these three loop that i run is because this will take each word form sub,v,o ex. first loop run = i  ,play , hokey
#secod loop = i , play ,footbal 
#third loop = i , love , hockey 
				phrase.write(sub + ' ' + v + ' ' + o + ' .\n') # to wirte in file 'Sentence_Genator.txt' , to join words from each variable , "./n" = when loops run and join each  variable the end spce"." and goses to next line by "\n" other wise it will print or write all possible sentences in a line.
